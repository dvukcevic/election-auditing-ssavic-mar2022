## Abstract

How can we trust an election outcome if we cannot fully scrutinise the count?

A statistical election audit can provide such assurance. This involves
examining a sample of the ballot papers to test the correctness of the outcome
statistically. Methods to do this have been developed, and deployed, for many
types of elections. Most of the action has been in the USA, where
‘risk-limiting audits’, pioneered by Prof. Stark, are now the gold-standard and
are being increasingly adopted. While such audits are not yet conducted in
Australia, the case for them is increasingly compelling. Legislation recently
passed will require an analysis similar to an audit at the upcoming Senate
election.

A major hurdle in Australia is that our election systems are very complex.
Senate elections, in particular, are beyond the capabilities of existing
auditing methods. We are currently tackling this challenge as part of a recent
grant from the Australian Research Council.

In our talk, we will introduce you to the basic statistical methods used for
auditing elections, and explain why this is so hard for Australian elections.
We'll provide some historical context for why auditing is important, and some
of the practical challenges in running a real audit. Finally, we'll give you
a glimpse of the latest progress in methods for tackling Australian elections.
